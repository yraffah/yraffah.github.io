<p>I just read this <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/FreeBSD_Daemons_and_Texans_don_t_mix">post</a> at digg.com and it was so much funny!</p><p><a href="http://rmitz.org/freebsd.daemon.html">here is the original full story</a></p><p>I just copied the text just in case the original page gets deleted;<img src="http://www.freebsd.org/gifs/daemon-phk.png" alt="" width="191" height="208" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 align="center">The FreeBSD Daemon</h1> <p>Linda Branagan is an expert on daemons.  She has a T-shirt that sports the daemon in tennis shoes that appears on the cover of the 4.3BSD manuals and <em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System</em> by S. Leffler, M. McKusick, M. Karels, J. Quarterman, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, MA 1989.</p> <p>She tells the following story about wearing the 4.3BSD daemon T-shirt:</p> <p>Last week I walked into a local &quot;home style cookin&#39; restaurant/watering hole&quot; in Texas to pick up a take-out order.  I spoke briefly to the waitress behind the counter, who told me my order would be done in a few minutes.</p> <p>So, while I was busy gazing at the farm implements hanging on the walls, I was approached by two &quot;natives.&quot;  These guys might just be the original Texas rednecks.</p> <p>``Pardon us, ma&#39;am.  Mind if we ask you a question?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Well, people keep telling me that Texans are real friendly, so I nodded.</p> <p>``Are you a Satanist?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Well, at least they didn&#39;t ask me if I liked to party.</p> <p>``Uh, no, I can&#39;t say that I am.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>``Gee, ma&#39;am.  Are you sure about that?&#39;&#39; they asked.</p> <p>I put on my biggest, brightest Dallas Cowboys cheerleader smile and said, ``No, I&#39;m positive.  The closest I&#39;ve ever come to Satanism is watching Geraldo.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>``Hmmm.  Interesting.  See, we was just wondering why it is you have the lord of darkness on your chest there.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>I was this close to slapping one of them and causing a scene -- then I stopped and noticed the shirt I happened to be wearing that day.  Sure enough, it had a picture of a small, devilish-looking creature that has for some time now been associated with a certain operating system.  In this particular representation, the creature was wearing sneakers.</p> <p>They continued: ``See, ma&#39;am, we don&#39;t exactly appreciate it when people show off pictures of the devil.  Especially when he&#39;s lookin&#39; so friendly.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>These idiots sounded terrifyingly serious.</p> <p>Me: ``Oh, well, see, this isn&#39;t really the devil, it&#39;s just, well, it&#39;s sort of a mascot.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Native: ``And what kind of football team has the devil as a mascot?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Me: ``Oh, it&#39;s not a team.  It&#39;s an operating -- uh, a kind of computer.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>I figured that an ATM machine was about as much technology as these guys could handle, and I knew that if I so much as uttered the word ``UNIX&#39;&#39; I would only make things worse.</p> <p>Native: ``Where does this satanical computer come from?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Me: ``California.  And there&#39;s nothing satanical about it really.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Somewhere along the line here, the waitress noticed my predicament -- but these guys probably outweighed her by 600 pounds, so all she did was look at me sympathetically and run off into the kitchen.</p> <p>Native: ``Ma&#39;am, I think you&#39;re lying.  And we&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d leave the premises now.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Fortunately, the waitress returned that very instant with my order, and they agreed that it would be okay for me to actually pay for my food before I left.  While I was at the cash register, they amused themselves by talking to each other.</p> <p>Native #1: ``Do you think the police know about these devil computers?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Native #2: ``If they come from California, then the FBI oughta know about &#39;em.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>They escorted me to the door.  I tried one last time: ``You&#39;re really blowing this all out of proportion.  A lot of people use this `kind of computers.&#39;  Universities, researchers, businesses.  They&#39;re actually very useful.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Big, big, BIG mistake.  I should have guessed at what came next.</p> <p>Native: ``Does the government use these devil computers?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Me: ``Yes.&#39;&#39;  Another BIG boo-boo.</p> <p>Native: ``And does the government pay for &#39;em?  With our tax dollars?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>I decided that it was time to jump ship.</p> <p>Me: ``No.  Nope.  Not at all.  Your tax dollars never entered the picture at all.  I promise.  No sir, not a penny.  Our good Christian congressmen would never let something like that happen.  Nope.  Never. Bye.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Texas.  What a country.</p>
