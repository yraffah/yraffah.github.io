Here I am back again to blogging after stopping for several years. I'm still not through with everything yet <s>but I'm currently migrating my old *Drupal* blog as well as my recent *Octopress* to *Jekyll*</s>, the greatest text-file-based blog.

## Remaining
As you can see, it is still a beta move and I have a lot remaining. Therefore, I thought of having it listed down so I can mark whatever is done once I'm through with it. Here goes the list:

1. <s>Migrate Octopress posts</s>
2. <s>Migrate old Drupal posts (Got to fix the current issue with the Drupal install!)</s>
3. <s>Comments (not sure if I really want it though)</s>
4. <s>Contact Form</s>
5. <s>Design</s> New theme
6. <s>Support for Twitter Cards</s>
7. <s>Tweet a post</s>
8. Fix imported posts
9. Add OG support
