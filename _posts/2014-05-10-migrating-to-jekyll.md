Here I am back again to blogging after stopping for several years. I'm still not through with everything yet but I'm currently migrating my old *Drupal* blog as well as my recent *Octopress" to *Jekyll*, the greatest text-file-based blog.

## Remaining
As you can see, it is still a beta move and I have a lot remaining. Therefore, I thought of having it listed down so I can mark whatever is done once I'm through with it. Here goes the list:

1. <s>Migrate Octopress posts</s>
2. Migrate old Drupal posts (Got to fix the current issue with the Drupal install!)
3. Comments (not sure if I really want it though)
4. Contact Form
5. Design
6. <s>Support for Twitter Cards</s>

Got some suggestions? Feel free to tweet it over to [@Yraffah](http://twitter.com/yraffah "Yousef Raffa")
