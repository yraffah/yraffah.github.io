Here I am back again to blogging after stopping for several years. I'm still not through with everything yet ~~but I'm currently migrating my old *Drupal* blog as well as my recent *Octopress* to *Jekyll*~~, the greatest text-file-based blog.

## Remaining
As you can see, it is still a beta move and I have a lot remaining. Therefore, I thought of having it listed down so I can mark whatever is done once I'm through with it. Here goes the list:

1. ~~Migrate Octopress posts~~
2. ~~Migrate old Drupal posts (Got to fix the current issue with the Drupal install!)~~
3. ~~Comments (not sure if I really want it though). Added Disqus.~~
4. ~~Contact Form~~
5. ~~Design~~ New theme
6. ~~Support for Twitter Cards~~
7. ~~Tweet a post~~
8. Fix imported posts
9. Add OG support

Got some suggestions? Feel free to tweet it over to [@Yraffah](http://twitter.com/yraffah "Yousef Raffa")
