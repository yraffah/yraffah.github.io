<div dir="ltr">As you can see, my blog is having some encoding issue due to database upgrade by the hosting company. I will be working on that to fix it in my freetime, I really had a lot to say and more to post but was <del>unluck</del> <ins>not lucky</ins> with the server upgrade. The weired thing though is that I have other blogs on the same server and they were not b0rked what so ever, the only difference is that they are using wordpress!

Anyhow, will see how things go from here and let's get things rolling now...
