After my last extremely exhausting [10K run]({% post_url 2012-03-15-My-first-10K-run %}), which was my first 10K; I had to take a good rest to give my body a good chance to recover. Tonight's run was the first run after the 10K milestone and it didn't start well.

## The Pain

While warming up, I started to feel some pain in my calves and for the first time in my knees. To be very frank I got worried and told myself "Let me give it few more minutes, if it didn't get better, I will stop". Luckily it did and I was able to finish my run.

As you know, the weather here in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, isn't fantastic; although we had great weather during Winter season but that is over now and it is getting really hot, even at night due to high levels of humidity in Jeddah.

## Tex

Tex loves to run with me and he was having a lot of fun during tonight's run. Unfortunately I wasn't able to take him off-leash since there were a lot of passing by cars due to a small vacation between the two semesters but non the less, he was happy.
