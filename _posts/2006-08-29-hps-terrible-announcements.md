<div dir="ltr">As you might have noticed, HP is conducting a "road show" in Riyadh on Linux and Open Source, which I <a href=http://yousef.raffah.com/?q=node/53>posted about earlier</a>. Thank you HP for your good intentions.

The bad thing is, their E-mail mentioned that it will be on the 5th of September
<cite>Date: 5th September, 2006</cite>
and the same was the message we received after the online registration. Now if you go to <a href=http://hplinuxroadshow.com/index.php?site=choose_location>HP's online web site</a>, you will see the event listed to be on the 6th!

But the strangest is when you click on the <a href=http://h40132.www4.hp.com/emea/events/event_info.asp?ev_id=4960&country=me&language=en>registration link</a>, you will see that the event is on the 5th of September but the last day of the registration is on 6th!

I also tried to contact them many times just to clear out the doubt but unfortunately did not get ANY response so far. However, I got the name of a contact person from HP's web site and E-mailed him the following message:

<cite>Dear Mr. Ammar,</cite>

<cite>I've been trying to contact HP for the last two weeks but unfortunately
did not get ANY response even after sending my third E-mail.</cite>

<cite>We would like to know when is the exact date of the HP Linux and Open
Source Roadshow in Riyadh going to be, is it the 5th or the 6th of
September? The E-mail we received was clearly showing it is on the 5th,
however, on the web site it shows the 6th but on another page, it shows
the 5th and the last date for registration is on the 6th! Although this
shows some internal miss communication within HP but we hope that we can
get a clear answer from you since you are the HP contact for the
event[1]</cite>

<cite>As you know, earlier reservations are required to assure availability
and we need prior notice in order to arrange with our management for
such trips since we are not based in Riyadh.</cite>

<cite>I tried to call you yesterday but your working hours ends at 5pm and a
call 5 minutes ago to your HP office ended with the operator telling me
that you are not available at office yet.</cite>

<cite>I will be waiting for your quick, kind and positive answer in order to
make myself available for the event and it would be a pleasure to meet
you in Riyadh. On the other hand, I would appreciate if HP would have
made better plans and clear notices for their events in Saudi Arabia
just like any event outside Saudi Arabia.</cite>
