### I'm finally back to blogging ###
It has been ages since I last wrote on my Arabic blog [Yousef Raffah's Blog](http://yousef.raffah.com/ "My Arabic Blog") and it has been much longer since I last wrote a blog post in English.
I'm very happy to announce today that this is not true anymore as I'm going to start writing back on this blog and in English. I'm still going to keep my [Arabic blog][1] for Arabic stuff
but this will be my English blog.

### So what's up with the no SQL/PHP thing? ###
I hated it! In fact, I always did! SQL was ugly, ridiculous, slow, frustrating, and etc. I never bothered to learn it or master it because I hated it but maintaining all my SQL based websites
was hectic job I had to do every now and then.  


This lead me to look for alternative solutions and one of my best friends spoke to me about it almost two years ago, **static** sites! Yes, sites that are not backed with SQL and are based
on flat files. Not even PHP coding or any server side scripting.  

All of the above applies to PHP as well. I hated it and never liked it as well :/

### Why are you telling us all this? ###
For several reasons:

1.  No SQL -> Faster page loads.
2.  No PHP -> Faster page loads.
3.  I can type with my preferred markup language [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown, by John Gruber"), by John Gruber.
4.  I wanted to learn something new.
5.  It is my blog and I can do whatever I like with it :P

### Why English? ###
A question may rise to a lot of visitors or readers questioning why would a Saudi man write or have a blog in English? While it may be a very valid question, I do have two answers for that:

1. I need to improve my English skills. We don't practice a lot of English in our daily lives unless we interact with an expat or someone that doesn't speak Arabic. Therefore, I'm considering this blog as one of my tools to improve my English language.
2. Since English is the international "standard" language, it is good for exposure and this way I can have more of a broader audience.
3. I already have an [Arabic blog][1]!
