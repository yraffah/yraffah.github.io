*Here is a photo of my first trial but the Go was not showing in this photo.*

# Watching movies at home

I like to watch movies and TV shows at home. (Update 2016: Now that Netflix is available in Saudi Arabia, I like to *Netflix* as well) Therefore, my movie setup should include a great TV, audio system, and overall environment.

Since I got a great Samsung Curved Smart TV and a nice sound system, all is left was a surrounding atmosphere and how to make it more enjoyable.

# Hello Hue

A lot of companies are competing in what is, in a layman's term, known as smart home devices. However, I decided to go with and just bought me a Philips [Hue starter kit](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/productdetail/philips-hue-white-and-color-ambiance-starter-kit-a19) , [Hue Iris](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/productdetail/philips-hue-iris), and [Hue Go](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/productdetail/philips-hue-go) in an attempt to have a cool looking lights around my TV setup while watching movies or TV shows while also having some smart home devices using IoT so I can control it through an app or maybe I can buy an [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011) later down the line.

I hooked up the bridge, which is the "main brain" that controls all Hue devices, to the internet, got its firmware updated, connected all the lights and played with it for a while until I decided to have the Iris on the right side of the TV but on the floor while having the Go on the left.

~~I might consider getting~~ I got the [Philips Hue Lightstrip](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/productdetail/philips-hue-lightstrip) to install it around the back of the TV as well in order to get a glow effect from behind later down the line.
