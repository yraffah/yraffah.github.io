<div dir="ltr">I received this E-mail from HP last week;

<cite>Dear Valued Customer,</cite>

<cite>Do you sometimes wonder about how easy or complicated it really is to deploy open source technology in the enterprise? Are you tempted by the well-documented cost savings, increased flexibility, and freedom associated with Linux and open source environments but perhaps concerned with potential risks of deployment?</cite>

<cite>What about legal issues?</cite>

<cite>These and many more questions will be addressed by industry leaders offering products and services at the upcoming HP Linux and Open Source Seminar.</cite>

<cite>Meet the experts from Intel, Novell, Oracle, Red Hat, SAP, HP, and others who will discuss the risks, offerings, and best practices in the open source world. Seize the opportunity to address topics to which you need expert answers, network with the key players, and discover how and where Linux and open source are being used today.</cite>
