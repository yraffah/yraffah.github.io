Everything seems ready except for the <s>**Portfolio** page</s>(That was my old Octopress-based site). Not sure if I should keep the **About** page with social links only or add some bio! it is 6:33am and I haven't slept since yesterday working on this! I guess that shows how much I'm liking the new site ;).

### Update 1 ###
_2011-08-11_

I just spent a whole Ramadan night working my @r$e of just to get this site up and running. Everything seems ready except for the Portfolio[^1] page. Not sure if I should keep the [About](/about/) page with social links only or add some bio! it is 6:33am and I haven't slept since yesterday working on this! I guess that shows how much I'm liking the new site ;).

Most of the time was spent on fixing the Disqus comments not showing, as if the JavaScript was not properly loaded. After spending hours on the issue I figured that the *[I'm back without SQL and PHP post][2]* on this blog has a single quote in the title, which caused a syntax error and that what caused Disqus not to load entirely. Thanks to [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez](https://github.com/josegonzalez) for giving me a hint on the problem by asking me to look for any JavaScript errors.

Working on the [Portfolio](/portfolio/) page.

I'm done working on the portfolio and now heading for some final touches and things missing here and there.

[^1]: That was on an old website. The current website doesn't have a portfolio page since everything is combined in the [About](/about/) page.
[2]: {% post_url 2011-08-10-I-am-back-without-sql %} "I'm Back without SQL and PHP!"
