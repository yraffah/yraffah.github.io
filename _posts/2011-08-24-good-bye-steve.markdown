### The shock

Everyone was shocked yesterday with the news of Steve Jobs, CEO of [Apple](http://www.apple.com/ "Apple Website") announcing [his resignation](http://http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Letter-from-Steve-Jobs.html "Steve Jobs Resignation Letter") from the CEO position. Some took it with a grain of salt while others where expecting it, like myself.

### The Expectations

To be honest, I was expecting him to do so a couple of years ago, especially with his medical conditions, yet, he only made the decision after proven to the world that Apple [is world's top brand](http://http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-Apple.html).

I always wondered how would people react to Steve leaving Apple, whether by choice or force, and most of my speculations where stating that a lot of people would overact by saying Apple is nothing without Steve or Apple will collapse and probably go bankrupt if Steve leaves, no way!

That is non-sense and just BS, Apple is extremely powerful, number one brand in the world reminder, and other companies has to really work their little bottoms.

### Only Time

Neither myself nor you can expect the future but tile will tell and prove which of us is correct and if I where you, I'de wait and see to cut on the crap!
