<p>I have been trying to fix my database for fixing the Arabic part of my posts but nothing have ever worked the way it should, I really appreciate all the great help offered by <a href="http://www.foolab.org">Mohammed Sameer </a>and <a href="http://www.milyani.com/arabic">Mohammad Milyani</a>. Therefore, I have decided, unfortunately, to discard and delete all my Arabic posts in order to start with a fresh new database, where I can have the joy of writing back in Arabic. Thanks to my host for the bork of the MySQL database during the upgrade!</p><p>Therefore, I will be off-line for sometime in order to upgrade and fix the remaining issues.<br /></p>
