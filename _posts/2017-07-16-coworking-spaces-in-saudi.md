I've been to several co-working spaces around the world. Some in the US, Europe and Japan in the last couple of years. It is very obvious that it is a trendy and hot thing and I guess it is contributing a lot to the ecosystem and entrepreneurial community out there, due to the huge mingling and networking effect it has.

# Great international examples

[Workbar](http://workbar.com/), [wework](https://www.wework.com/), [**GREENTOWN**LABS](https://www.greentownlabs.com/), and so many others might not be the pioneers but they are certainly some of the well known ones. Some are general spaces while others are focused on a certain theme or type of customers. I rememeber visiting a co-working space in Manhattan, NYC, that was only suitable for authors and writers. GREENTOWNLABS for example is focused on green energy start-up companies.


# The scene in Saudi

While most of the business world here still does not understand the true meaning of a "Co-working" space, I think there is a very strong chance for it to succeed in this part of the world as well, for many reasons. People here still think of co-working spaces like serviced offices! There is a huge difference between both. [SERVCORP](http://www.servcorp.com/en/) is one of the well known examples of serviced offices in Saudi Arabia.


(**Update 2017**) It seems SERVCORP started offering co-working space service recently but I have my doubts that it will be a true co-working space.

[WhiteSpace](http://www.wspace.com.sa/) is one of the examples that understands the difference between a co-working space and a serviced office, yet they decided to focus on being a serviced office service provider due to market demand.

Some of the smart ones had started already as I can see few in Riyadh and I recently heard about ones in Jeddah as well. **The Space** was one of the pioneer co-working spaces in Jeddah and [SHEWORKS](http://sheworks.com.sa/wordpress/) is one of the first ones I read about in Riyadh, which is a co-working space dedicated for females.

It seems that there are more coming into the scene lately as a quick Google search shows some, that I haven't visited yet, such as [Regus](http://www.saudiarabia.regus.com/en-gb/office-space/saudi-arabia/jeddah/jeddah-bin-sulaiman) and [The Work Hub](http://theworkhub.me/) in Jeddah and I'm sure there are more in Riyadh and other cities.

## Vision 2030

With the announcement on April 2016 of the [Saudi's Vision 2030](http://vision2030.gov.sa/), there is a huge focus on SMEs and start-ups. The whole government is shifting its focus from being an oil-dependent economy and diversify that which is all explained on the [Vision 2030's](http://vision2030.gov.sa/) website. Immediately after the announcement Saudi Arabia has invested in many international companies such as [Uber](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/technology/uber-investment-saudi-arabia.html) through the [Public Investment Fund](http://pif.gov.sa/) (PIF).

Many government entities and ministries underwent restructuring process to align with this vision. This shows how serious the government is and there is a clear [focus in the vision](http://vision2030.gov.sa/en/node/8) on the importance of SMEs and entrepreneurial activity.

## SMEA initiatives

As one of the outcomes of the vision, [Saudi's Small and Medium Entreprises Authority, monsha'at](https://smea.gov.sa) was established and it has many initiatives to be implimented across the kingdom, one of which is co-working spaces. I'm really keen to see how it will be executed and wish it a great success. Though it is a semi-governmental initiative, it has to have a revenue stream in order to be sustainable, otherwise, it will be shutdown.
