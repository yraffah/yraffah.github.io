## Finally Received

Since Nike announced their new NIKE+ FUELBAND I immediately felt the need for one. Compared to other health monitoring gadgets/devices it beats them all in terms of design, functionality, and most importantly, community; which is a killer thing when it comes to Nike+.

Unfortunately, like many out there and probably like you as well, I wasn’t able to get it due to its low stock availability. This thing is selling like hot cakes and keeps on getting out of stock. The only way for me to get one was by following their twitter accounts in order to know as soon as any stock quantity and place an order through one of my friends in the US since their store doesn’t accept credit cards issued from Saudi Arabia (We are in 2012 for god’s sake!).
