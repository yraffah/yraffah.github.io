# The detox specialist
I recently had the chance to visit a detoxing specialist in Turkey during a quick trip with my pal [Ahmed Al-Awadi](http://www.instagram.com/ahmed_awadi). She offered to do red blood cells analysis, which gives an indicator of how your blood flows and the way it carries oxygen to your organs. She initially started with him and took a blood sample from his index, put it on her microscope and we saw something like never before on the huge TV screen.

## The first blood sample
Ahmed's blood sample (*below*) looked really good (Ma sha'a Allah). The specialist said it was perfect, smooth, and just couldn't be better. As you can see from the photo, the red blood cells are firmly round and has room to roam around and flow. They look healthy or shall I say "Happy :)". From my personal observation, Ahmed is a normal person eating a regular diet, yet, he tries to avoid fried food if possible.

Some of you might know I have high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL Cholesterol), as I explained earlier in my [marathon post](). Therefore, I expected my blood sample to be a little bit different than Ahmed's. That feeling started to build up until I became worried. The minute she saw my blood cells she started to re-adjust the focus of the microscope, I knew something was wrong! It took her a good minute or two before displaying it on the big TV screen and that is when I got **shocked** to say the least.
