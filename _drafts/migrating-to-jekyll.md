Here I am back again to blogging after stopping for several years. I'm still not through with everything yet but I'm currently migrating my old *Drupal* blog as well as my recent *Octopress" to *Jekyll*, the greatest text-file-based blog.

## Remaining
As you can see, it is still a beta move and I have a lot remaining. Therefore, I thought of having it listed down so I can mark whatever is done once I'm through with it. Here goes the list:

1. Migrate Octopress posts
2. Migrate old Drupal posts
3. Comments
4. Contact Form
