After discovering I had very high levels of [low density lipoprotein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein) (LDL Cholesterol), in addition to me being overweight. I decided it was really important to re-focus on my health for the sake of myself, my family, and the *mankind* :). Since then, I started changing my eating and cooking habits, in addition to a little bit of cardio exercises, basically walking and jogging.

Fast forward to one and half years after that, I started practicing for the yearly half-marathon race "[Jeddah Marathon](http://jeddah-marathon.com/)" with a very enthusiastic team lead by [Ali Sheneamer](https://twitter.com/sheneamer).

We trained for less than a month with a schedule of 3 days a week in the beginning then intensive trainings on the last week and a half. I personally was progressing well, according to my athletic status, as you can see in the below image.

## Jeddah Marathon snags
First, media coverage and publicity were terrible. I didn't know about it unless and until Ali[^1] asked me to join the team about a month before the race! Since this is becoming an annual race in Jeddah, I believe it should be marketed in a much better manner. Awareness campaigns here and there. Involve school kids to let them know the importance of running or sports in general and so many other ways.

Take [Boston's Athletic Association](http://www.baa.org/) for example, they open registration for races almost three months in advance for their [annual Boston's half marathon](http://www.baa.org/races/half-marathon/participant-information.aspx). This gives enough time for participants to prepare themselves and for marketing campaigns to gain publicity and have a much wider reach so you get more people know about the race, which leads us to my third point. Meanwhile, I appreciate the fact that it is a free registration race but I honestly don't mind paying 100 S.R. ($26) or 200 S.R. ($53) but I would expect something very similar to what BAA are doing.

Next, the number badges distribution channels. One of these channels was in [Red Sea Mall](http://www.redseamall.com/), Jeddah's biggest mall, at a little booth. Unfortunately the representatives were not there during the day, they only come at evenings! Which made me search for another location until I finally got my badge after several days. I had to figure out how to have it attached to my t-shirt.

Then, and just as referenced earlier, during the start of the race, there were few hundreds of *alien participants* that organizers has brought, just for the *show* and media, in order to show the public that there were thousands of participants. In fact, this happened even last year according to Ali's feedback. I saw them myself, as soon as the race started, then ran like crazy for cameras and photographers. 20 or 30 meters later then took a left turn and hopped into their busses! That is pathetic and very non-ethical, IMHO[^2].

Finally, and that was their biggest fail. After an hour of the race start, police and organizers **stopped protecting and guarding the roads!** This means all waiting cars were free to go and so they did. They had to pass between running participants, which was really stupid and *dangerous*. Imagine an outrageous driver passing by you while you were running in the middle of the road! That is just **insane**. Initially we didn't understand why and some participants didn't want to continue the race. I told myself I have to finish it no matter what and kept moving forward.
