After discovering I had very high levels of [low density lipoprotein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein) (LDL Cholesterol), in addition to me being overweight. I decided it was really important to re-focus on my health for the sake of myself, my family, and the *mankind* :). Since then, I started changing my eating and cooking habits, in addition to a little bit of cardio exercises, basically walking and jogging.

Fast forward to one and half years after that, I started practicing for the yearly half-marathon race "[Jeddah Marathon](http://jeddah-marathon.com/)" with a very enthusiastic team lead by [Ali Sheneamer](https://twitter.com/sheneamer).

We trained for less than a month with a schedule of 3 days a week in the beginning then intensive trainings on the last week and a half. I personally was progressing well, according to my athletic status, as you can see in the below image.
