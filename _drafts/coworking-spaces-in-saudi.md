I've been to several co-working spaces around the world. Some in the US, Europe and Japan in the last couple of years. It is very obvious that it is a trendy and hot thing and I guess it is contributing a lot to the ecosystem and entrepreneurial community out there, due to the huge mingling and networking effect it has.

# Great international examples

Workbar, wework, greentownlabs, and so many others might not be the pioneers but they are certainly some of the well known ones. Some are general spaces while others are focused on a certain theme or type of customers. I rememeber visiting a co-working space in Manhattan, NYC, that is only suitable for authors and writers.

# The scene in Saudi

While most of the business world here still does not understand the true meaning of a "Co-working" space, I think there is a very strong chance for it to succeed in this part of the world as well, for many reasons. People here still think of co-working spaces like serviced offices! There is a huge difference between both.


Some of the smart ones had started already as I can see few in Riyadh and I recently heard about ones in Jeddah as well. She-works is one of the first ones I read about in Riyadh, which is a co-working space dedicated for females.

## SMEA initiatives

[Saudi's Small and Medium Entreprises Authority]() has many initiatives to be implimented across the kingdom, one of which is co-working spaces. I'm really keen to see how it will be executed and wish it a great success. Though it is a semi-governmental initiative, it has to have a revenue stream in order to be sustainable, otherwise, it will be shutdown.
