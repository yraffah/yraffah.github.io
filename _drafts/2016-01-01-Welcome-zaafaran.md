![Za'afaran at home][zaafaran]

I've owned several trucks and SUVs in my life since I was in high-school. My first was a 1988 Chevy Blazer, then an Infiniti QX4, and finally a 2009 Sierra Denali. My friend however had 1996 Jeep wrangler back then, which was a brand new, and I felt in love with Jeeps ever since and always had the intention of getting one, especially that I go camping and off-roading during the winter season [^1].


After many, many years, I'm happy to announce that I just got me a Jeep with the following specs and some mods:

* 1995 Jeep Wrangler YJ (Yellow)
* 4.0L I6 Engine (Original engine was blown and PO replaced it with a 1997 engine) with 194K KM (That is 121K Miles)
* 5 Speed Manual Gearbox (ATX-15)
* Hard Top (I don't think it is the original one)
* K&N Air filter
* Throttle body spacer
* 3" headers with no pipes/mufflers. Yes it is VERY loud and noisy
* Unknown after market body lift (I guess it is a 1" or 1.5")
* 10" GT Radial wheels
* Unknown aftermarket half doors


The car was in an acceptable condition and almost has no rust neither in the frame nor the body. My plans are big for this project car and I have started a [build thread on WranglerForum.com](http://www.wranglerforum.com/f330/zaafaran-saffron-1995-yj-build-1588882.html).

# What is it with the name?

Za'afaran (*pronounced: Zaa faran*) is the Arabic name of [Saffron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron). This car is originally Red but it was painted Yellow by the **P**revious **O**wner (PO). Therefore, I thought Saffron is the best matching name since it is actually Red but it produces that cool Yellow colour.

# List of upgrades and fixes

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm in no way a mechanic or understand car mechanics. All what I do is for my own and personal reference and education. It is my car and I can brake it, as a matter of fact I did many times, and I should **NOT** and can **NOT**, be responsible for your errors, mistakes, or stupidity.

[^1]: Yes, we go off-roading during winter season as the weather cools a lot and we can enjoy getting warm near the fire. However, in summer, the desert gets VERY hot and you get to encounter with many reptiles and insects, that you could've avoided in winter.
