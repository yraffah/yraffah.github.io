During my [MIT REAP](http://reap.mit.edu/) program and exactly in the last part of last session, the "Professor" [Bill Aulet](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/detail/?id=9118)[^1], Managing Director, Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, wanted to end his session with few inspiring words by quoting someone. I think most of the 60Â± audience thought he would quote Drucker, Ford, or some sort of a business man. He surprised us all when he played the chorus of ["Lose Yourself"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lose_Yourself) by Eminem!, which says:

```
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
```

The whole crowd cheered and I personally think he nailed it. Entrepreneurs seek opportunities and should never miss a chance to make a change, or should I say *"blow"*, as you only get **One** shot.

Thank you Bill for such inspiration and we, as entrepreneurs, shall seek such opportunities.

Enjoy the video and let me know what do you think down in the comments. Do you think Bill plays it for his MBA students as well? (*I personally do think so*).
