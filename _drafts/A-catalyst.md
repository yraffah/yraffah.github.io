## A catalyst for startups and SMEs
We are currently establishing Namaa Al Munawara in Medina province, which will be the central hub, state-owned company, that helps and provides services for startups and SMEs. Since we currently don't have any sort of a solid entrepreneurial ecosystem in Saudi, Namaa Al Munawara is taking the lead and implementing it at a regional level in Madina.

## Objectives

Our main objectives at Namaa are:

1. To have a *sustainable economic development*
2. Create *regional socio-economic impact on citizens*

## What are we going to do?

Namaa is mandated with three main roles:

1. Facilitation hub (Policy execution)
2. Initiatives' execution (Initiatives and investments)
3. Ecosystem enhancement (Get a fair chance of government quotas for SMEs)

### Facilitation hub

### Initiatives' execution

### Ecosystem enhancement
