## A catalyst for startups and SMEs
We are currently establishing Namaa Al Munawara in Medina province, which will be the central hub, state-owned company, that helps and provides services for startups and SMEs. Since we currently don't have any sort of entrepreneurial ecosystem in Saudi, Namaa Al Munawara is taking the lead and implementing it at a regional level.

## Three main roles

Namaa is mandated with three main roles:

1. Facilitation hub (Policy execution)
2. Initiatives' execution (Initiatives and investments)
3. Ecosystem enhancement (Get a fair chance of government quotas for SMEs)

## Main objectives

Our main objectives at Namaa are:

1. To have a *sustainable economic development*
2. Create *regional socio-economic impact on citizens*
