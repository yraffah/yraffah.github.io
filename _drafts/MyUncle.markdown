## A Retired Saudi Pilot

Sami Raffa, my oldest uncle is a retired pilot. He is considered one of the first Saudi pilots and has served many years in [Saudia Airlines](http://www.saudiairlines.com/) as well as the royal sector.

He used to tell many stories of incidents and adventures that he lived during many years of service. Things that he saw and others that he interacted with. Uncle Sami was always an adventurer and to me is one of the first geeks I ever met in my life. He always had those amazing gadgets and crazy type of electronics, he was a pioneer.
I still remember the electronic pieces he had on his cycling bikes, shoes, and wrist bands. The garage he had in his basement which is more of a workshop for the RC aircrafts and helicopters he used to build by hand with steam or gasoline engines.

## Around The World in 40 Days

This time he is doing something else; he will fly around the world in 40 days on his own aircraft. The initial plan was to fly solo but I guess certain conditions didn't allow such a thing so his daughter is going along with him.

He had to modify the plane a bit by installing extra fuel tanks in the passengers' compartment which should give him extra milage to fly without stopping for fuel. The departure of the trip will be from Al-Madinah Al-Monawarah airport towards Abu-Dhabi, UAE.

This video has a quick interview with him in the first few minutes.

## Why are you doing it?

He spoke to me once about the trip at his house and told me the main reason was to show the world that Saudies and especially Saudi pilots are not terrorist and they were not violant. They are peaceful and that is "Salam" means in Arabic, Peace.
